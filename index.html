          <span>"A hero is someone who you look up to because of what they have done or because of what they do.
           Maya Angelou is a heroine because she encourages people to “take life by the lapels”, to face your trials and hardships.
            She is a person who looks for the positive and never gives up. Her ability to stay strong throughout the early years of her life makes her a hero to me.
             She sacrificed herself for others so they could have a better life. She shows leadership by writing all these books about her life and telling people to be positive."-Leilani from Kahului

          "Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age, and used poetry and other great literature to cope with trauma,
          as she described in her first and most well-known autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.
          She became a poet after a series of occupations as a young adult, including as a cast member of a
          European tour of Porgy and Bess, and a performer of calypso music in nightclubs in the 1950s."

          <p>
            She is a woman who has overcome hardships almost all her life.
            She had the courage and determination to stay strong.
            Her words stir people up and create insight to a whole new world for her
            readers which makes her one of the most influential heroine's of the 21st century.
            The tranformation from all the traumas she endured to her greatest achivements are a great inspiration.
